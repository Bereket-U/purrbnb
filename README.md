## Getting Started
### [Visit the app here](https://purrbnb.herokuapp.com)
* It’s simple and intuitive to use. This project uses single page application , meaning everything loads dynamically. 
* You can visualize all listings by clicking the home page. Once it’s done, the page will dynamically load without refreshing bringing you the current listings and our map.
* On your user add listing page, you also have the chance of adding your own listing page that will appear on the homepage along with listings added by other users.
* To view your listings you go to the page with your user name / profile page and it will be visible under "My Listings".You can also delete/edit from there as well.  
* Once you’ve clicked on “My Listings”, a new window will be shown where you have the opportunity to view all your previous listings.
